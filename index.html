            My favourite hobby is Solving Riddles. I enjoy Solving riddles when I am free. I
            started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
            kept solving riddles. My favorite ficitional character is Sherlock Holmes. I find him very interesting andv facinating. One day i want to become like him.
